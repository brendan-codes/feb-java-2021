EXAM PREP

take 100% of the exam time don’t drop out hours early because you are stuck! bugs might take a while to find, but they rarely take a long time to fix.

don’t panic the only risk of here is you find and expose your weaknesses and where you need additional study. this is not a placement exam, you are doing it to learn.

don’t watch the clock try to set alarms for a midway point, a last hour, a last 15 minutes. clock watching kills braincells.

start with what you know save confusing bugs especially related to black belt features for the end if you don't know how to do it, circle back if you finish 100% of everything you know, how close are you to finishing?

finish the wireframe no matter what, rain or shine, finish the challenge you were given

don’t hit start until you have your environment and boilerplate ready, don’t write everything from scratch under exam time, do what you know you’ll need first! (Spring Boot, dependencies, index.jsp, login and reg, models, controllers, repos, etc)

follow the exam prompt as a checklist and double check it against your app before submitting

don’t overthink features do exactly what the exam asks and no more do not redesign major features do what you were asked to do MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WORK NOT DONE

remember your training you’ve done many or most of these features in the last month, the platform has answers for 100% of the red belt requirements.

open notes, open platform, open internet the only place you can't look is on github for other specific belt related solutions

if you have any problems submitting submit to me on discord or submit to an optional assignment on learn

if you go over time, submit anyway and you will get a code review

always submit code, i’ll review it and give feedback

no matter what, start the exam, take the wireframe, and consider it before monday!! we WILL be going over it!

don’t worry about a video just bring it to me when you’re done

follow the bullet list it's a list of exam requirements, don’t worry about the post-it notes on the wireframe itself

join the lecture room so i can assign you a breakout space
